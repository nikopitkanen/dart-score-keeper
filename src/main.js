// To achieve modularity project uses MVC model: main.js = controller, game.js = model, ui.js = view.
// controllers task is to connect model and view.
// model handles all the logic.
// view handles all the updates of the ui.
// remember to export game.js and ui.js here!!!
// this is just a test comment
